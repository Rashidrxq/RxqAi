# 🌟 PROJECT REPORT: Hotel Customer Care Chatbot System

---

## 🏨 1. Project Title

**“AI-Powered Hotel Customer Care Chatbot System”**
*(A conversational assistant for hotel guests and management)*

---

## 🎯 2. Project Objective

To design and develop an **AI chatbot system** that can handle **hotel customer interactions automatically**, including answering FAQs, assisting with room bookings, handling complaints, and collecting feedback — thereby **reducing staff workload** and **enhancing guest satisfaction** through **24/7 intelligent support**.

---

## 🧩 3. Problem Statement

In many hotels, customer care and front desk staff handle repetitive questions:

* “What’s the check-in time?”
* “Do you have free Wi-Fi?”
* “Can I book a deluxe room for tomorrow?”

These tasks consume time and create **delays** in service. During peak hours or late nights, guests often **don’t get instant help**.

A chatbot that can **understand natural language** and **automate responses** will:

* Free staff from repetitive tasks.
* Provide guests with **instant answers**.
* Handle simple bookings or direct complex queries to human staff.

---

## 🧠 4. Solution Overview

The proposed **Hotel Customer Care Chatbot System** uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to communicate with guests through a chat interface.

It will:

* Answer frequently asked questions.
* Help users **book rooms** and **check availability**.
* Handle complaints and provide contact details.
* Escalate unrecognized or critical queries to hotel staff.
* Work on **web**, **mobile**, or even **WhatsApp**.

## 🧩 6. Functional Modules

### **1️⃣ User Interface (Frontend)**

* Simple, chat-like interface embedded in the hotel website or app.
* Shows messages, hotel logo, typing indicator, and options.
* Example stack: HTML/CSS/JS or React.js (for advanced).

**Key Screens:**

* Home page with chatbot widget.
* Chat window (conversation interface).
* Booking confirmation popup or summary screen.

---

### **2️⃣ Backend / Middleware**

Acts as the “brain connector” between the chatbot, database, and hotel systems.

**Functions:**

* Receives chat requests from frontend.
* Calls the NLP engine (Dialogflow/OpenAI).
* Retrieves hotel data from database (room info, FAQs).
* Sends reply back to frontend.

**Tech Stack:** Flask (Python) or Node.js (Express).

---

### **3️⃣ NLP Engine (AI Chatbot Core)**

This is the “intelligent” part that understands and processes user queries.

You can choose one of the following approaches:

| Option                        | Platform     | Description                                          |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dialogflow**                | Google       | Easiest setup, GUI-based intent design, multilingual |
| **Rasa**                      | Open Source  | More control, can run locally                        |
| **OpenAI GPT-4 API**          | Cloud API    | Most human-like responses, easy integration          |
| **Hugging Face Transformers** | Local or API | Use fine-tuned models for hospitality                |

**Key Tasks:**

* Detect user **intent** (e.g., “Book Room”, “Check Price”, “Restaurant Info”).
* Extract **entities** (dates, room type, number of guests).
* Generate appropriate **responses** or actions.

---

### **4️⃣ Database Layer**

Stores:

* Room details, prices, availability.
* User chat history (optional).
* Feedback forms.
* Staff escalation logs.

**Example Schema (MySQL):**

| Table      | Columns                                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `rooms`    | id, type, price, availability, amenities           |
| `bookings` | id, user_name, room_id, date_from, date_to, status |
| `faq`      | id, question, answer                               |
| `users`    | id, name, email, phone                             |

---

### **5️⃣ Admin Dashboard**

A simple web portal for hotel staff to:

* View live chats.
* Reply manually if bot fails.
* Manage FAQs, rooms, prices.
* Check booking reports.

**Example:**
Frontend → React
Backend → Flask API
Authentication → JWT
